<h1> House_prediction_model </h1>
A house price prediction system was built by training and comparing multiple machine learning models. The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics and further improved using hyperparameter tuning. The final optimized model provides more accurate and reliable price predictions.
House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach. The best-performing model was further optimized using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy and generalization.

Models Used

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model Selection and Optimization

All models were compared using appropriate evaluation metrics. Based on performance results, the most suitable model was selected and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to reduce overfitting and enhance model accuracy.

Key Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models

Hyperparameter tuning of the best model

Model persistence for future predictions

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models

Outcome

The final optimized model provides reliable and accurate house price predictions and can be extended for deployment using web frameworks.

If you want, I can also make a one-page short README, add dataset details, or write a separate README for your Iris project.
